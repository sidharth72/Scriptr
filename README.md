# Scriptr

Scriptr is a fine-tuned Gemma 2 2B instruct model designed for generating YouTube scripts based on provided keywords. This project leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to create high-quality and relevant scripts efficiently.

## Features

- Generates YouTube scripts from simple keyword inputs.
- Supports inference on both CPU and GPU environments.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
- `torch`
- `bitsandbytes`
- `transformers`
- `peft`
- `accelerate`
- `trl`

### Installation and Usage
1. Navigate to the `Scriptr` directory.
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install torch bitsandbytes transformers peft accelerate trl
```

#### Logging to Huggingface Hub

Since the base model repo is gated, we need to authenticate to hugging face to load the model, so first go to hugging face and start an account if you don't have one, then head over to this link: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens for grabbing your ACCESS TOKEN. Then on the terminal run,

Note: Make sure you have write and read access to the API keys.

```
huggingface-cli login --token <YOUR_API_TOKEN>
```

4. Run the `inference.py` file:
```
python inference.py
```
- **CPU Environment**: Expect slower performance.
- **GPU Environment**: Significantly faster inference.

## Notes
- The first run may take some time as the model initializes.
- Ensure a compatible GPU is available for optimal performance.
